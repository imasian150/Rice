## History of Rice~
Rice has been deduced to be used for consumption purposes in Yangtze River in China approximately 10,000 to 14,000 years ago.  Then, 8,000 years ago, the creation of agriculture and farming rice was created and continued to expand for the next 2,000 years until it became a central part of asian culture and cuisine.  Because rice is so versatile and flexible, being able to grow in a variety of environments, rice spread quickly to India through Sri Lanka.  Then, it arrived in Europe to Greece, and was able to spread to the New World and the rest of North and South America.
